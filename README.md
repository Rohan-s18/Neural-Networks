## Author: Rohan Singh
This repository contains the source code for various types of Neural Networks from scratch, as well as their applications. The types of Neural Networks in this repository range from simple neural networks (single layer, hidden layer) to more advanced multi-layer neural networks. The source code in this directory is Python and no external libraries libraries like Scikit-learn, Keras etc. are used.

## Simple Neural Networks
This Directory contains the source code for some of the basic types of Neural Networks, these include:
